# HW4
GUI hw4
Hi, I beleive I demonstrated an understanding of using jquery error validation. I really struggled with HW3 and it took more hours and hours trying to figure out how to get my table to output and I just couldn't crack it.I tried to use classmates describing how they did it as a reference but I just couldnt crack it sorry about that. I do feel like i did everything that was necassray to show error validation. I will list my sources that I used to get this to work below. Any questions email me.I used my late hw token on this as well thank you.
